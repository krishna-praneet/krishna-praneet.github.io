projects:
  - title: "LDPC Decoders for Quantum Error Correcting Codes"
    period: "Jun '23 - May '24"
    description: "Developed and deployed a software library of simple iterative bit-flip and belief propagation decoding algorithms in Julia. Implemented Ordered Statistics Decoding processing that improved logical error rate by 20% for LDPC qubit codes"
  
  - title: "Stock Trading System"
    period: "Feb '23 - May '23"
    description: "Developed a 3-tier stock trading server using Python that handles requests from various clients using a thread-pool mode with replication and consistency accross failures. Also Implemented Least Recently Used caching for improving latency of requests."
  
  - title: "Stock Recommendation System"
    period: "Feb '23 - Feb '23"
    description: "Developed a stock recommendation system using Python which analyzes historical data using PySpark and PyTorch. Implemented LSTM, Random Forest, and Factorization Machine models from SparkMLLib to predict stock closing prices"
  
  - title: "Elevation-based Navigation System (EleNa)"
    period: "Oct '22 - Dec '22"
    description: "Built a navigation app using JavaScript and React to suggest the shortest path between two user-defined locations. Implemented Dijkstra's, A*, and BFS algorithms with elevation gain and achieved the best performance with the first two"
