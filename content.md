# About Me

Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. My research is focussed on the engineering and decarbonization of cloud and AI systems. Prior to this, I completed my Masters at UMass Amherst, with a thesis on LDPC Decoders for Quantum Error correction. I also have 2 years of experience working in the industry as a full-stack software engineer at Deskera, where I worked on the development of distributed and parallel microservices (Java Spring) + ReactJS UIs for business data flow across multiple e-commerce platforms. I am also a holder of a bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

## Projects

### LDPC Decoders for Quantum Error Correcting Codes
**Jun '23 - May '24**

Developed and deployed a software library of simple iterative bit-flip and belief propagation decoding algorithms in Julia  
Implemented Ordered Statistics Decoding processing that improved logical error rate by 20% for LDPC qubit codes

### Stock Trading System
**Feb '23 - May '23**

Developed a 3-tier stock trading server using Python that handles requests from various clients using a thread-pool mode with replication and consistency accross failures. Also Implemented Least Recently Used caching for improving latency of requests.

### Stock Recommendation System
**Feb '23 - Feb '23**

Developed a stock recommendation system using Python which analyzes historical data using PySpark and PyTorch  
Implemented LSTM, Random Forest, and Factorization Machine models from SparkMLLib to predict stock closing prices

### Elevation-based Navigation System (EleNa)
**Oct '22 - Dec '22**

Built a navigation app using JavaScript and React to suggest the shortest path between two user-defined locations  
Implemented Dijkstra's, A*, and BFS algorithms with elevation gain and achieved the best performance with the first two
